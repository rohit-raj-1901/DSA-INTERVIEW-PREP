## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science that play a crucial role in writing efficient and optimized code. This repository serves as a collection of well-commented implementations of common data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc., and algorithms like sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.

## Data Structures

- **Array**: Implementation of dynamic arrays.
- **Linked List**: Implementation of singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
- **Stack**: Implementation of stack data structure.
- **Queue**: Implementation of queue data structure.
- **Tree**: Implementation of binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, etc.
- **Graph**: Implementation of graph data structure using adjacency lists or adjacency matrices.
- **Heap**: Implementation of binary heaps (min heap, max heap).
- **Hash Table**: Implementation of hash table (hash map).

## Algorithms

- **Sorting**: Implementation of various sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, etc.
- **Searching**: Implementation of linear search, binary search, etc.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Implementation of BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Implementation of dynamic programming algorithms for problems like Fibonacci series, longest common subsequence, knapsack problem, etc.

## Usage

You can browse through the source files to understand how each data structure and algorithm is implemented. Feel free to use them in your projects or as a reference for learning purposes.

To compile and run the C++ programs, you can use any standard C++ compiler like `g++` or an integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code, CLion, etc.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any bugs, issues, or want to contribute improvements or new implementations, feel free to open a pull request or raise an issue in the repository.

Please make sure to follow the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting your contributions.
